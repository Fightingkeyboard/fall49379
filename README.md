# Smart Contract Proposal
By: Anthony Chen

## Idea

I was inspired when browsing reddit, where I found a post in a gaming subreddit urging fans to go to a specific website to rate their game five stars. The clickbait website was obviously just trying to make money by appealing to die-hard fans.

So I asked myself, why can't I do the same thing, but instead of a website I just use a smart contract? Have people pay in eth for the privilege of rating their beloved game and pocket all their money.

## How it's going to work
1. First, the user submits their """""""review""""""" with a small payment to the smart contract
2. Then, the smart contract (me) pocket the money (if I'm doing this for real)'
3. The review and rating is stored and average rating for the game computed.
4. Next, If the user rates the game highly, the user get a message telling them that their game is the highest rated and is obviously a person of fine taste. If the user rate it poorly, the user gets a message telling them that they're courageous for standing up to the astroturfing/marketing campaign of the absolutely terrible game.
    -they rate their game highly but there is a game with a higher rating, return a message that while their game was good, there is a higher rated game, and provide one of the higher rated game's reviews
5. Attempt to get stir up a war between fans of different games or get an angry mob to review bomb a bad game to get more users.
6. Loob back to step 1. Profit.
